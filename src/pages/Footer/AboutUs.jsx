      <section>
        <p>
          At Vara, we believe music should be limitless — not limited by
          copyright headaches, expensive licensing, or endless searches for
          the “perfect” track.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re a subscription-based AI music platform built for creators,
          filmmakers, businesses, and storytellers who need high-quality,
          ready-to-use music without the legal uncertainty.

        <h2 className="footer-page-section-title">What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          Our AI generates music across multiple genres, moods, and styles —
          from motivational beats to romantic soundscapes, from documentary
          background scores to cinematic trailers.
        </p>
        <p>Every track comes with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>BPM (Beats Per Minute)</li>
          <li>Musical Key</li>
          <li>
            Vocal Information (so you know if the song has vocals or is
            instrumental)
          </li>
          <li>
            Genre & Sub-Genre Tags (so you can search by YouTube categories
            or mood)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We update our library every week, giving you fresh music so your
          content never feels repetitive.

        <h2 className="footer-page-section-title">Why Vara Exists</h2>
        <p>We know the struggle:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Hours lost searching for “royalty-free” music that still triggers
            copyright claims
          </li>
          <li>Confusing license terms that scare away creators</li>
          <li>High costs for even a single track</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Vara changes that. With one simple subscription, you can access our
          entire library and download up to 50 songs per month — each ready
          for commercial use under our license.
